//Having a file called layout will wrap all pages in that branch of the app directory.
//If you want routes that have a different layout than other routes create a route group by making a folder with parens around the name, and
//put the layout along with all the routes in there. 
//just like in next 12 folders create a route and should be lowercase.
//in app directory though files dont create a route, only folders and to create a page for that route it needs a file in it called page.
